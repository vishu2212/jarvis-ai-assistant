## ✨ Why JARVIS? (A Humanised Perspective)

Have you ever wanted an intelligent voice assistant like JARVIS or Alexa, but wished it was **completely private**, **fully customizable**, and didn't send every word spoken in your home to a distant cloud server?

That is exactly why **JARVIS** was created!

JARVIS splits the workload smartly between two partners:
1. **The Satellite (Hardware Client):** A lightweight, low-cost ESP32-S3 microcontroller placed on your desk. It acts as the "ears, mouth, and eyes" of the assistant — capturing your voice via an INMP441 I2S mic, giving visual feedback on a tiny OLED screen, and speaking back through a clear I2S DAC speaker.
2. **The Brain (Local PC Server):** A Python FastAPI server that runs locally on your PC. It takes raw digital audio over WebSockets, transcribes it in real-time with **Faster-Whisper**, thinks using **Qwen 2.5** (via LM Studio), and speaks back using human-sounding neural voices with **Piper TTS**.

Whether you want a desk companion, a home automation trigger, or a voice interface for a robotics project, JARVIS gives you 100% control over every single line of code and piece of hardware.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔒 **100% Offline & Private:** Zero cloud APIs required. Your voice data never leaves your local network.
- ⚡ **Ultra Low-Latency WebSockets:** Binary 16kHz PCM audio streaming over standard WebSockets ensures instant response times.
- 🗣️ **Local Multilingual STT & TTS:** Handles English, Hindi, and Hinglish with Whisper transcription and Piper neural voice models (`en_US-lessac` and `hi_IN-pratham`).
- 📺 **Dynamic OLED Visualizer:** Real-time state indicators (`Connecting`, `Ready`, `Listening...`, `Thinking...`, `Speaking...`) with animated visualizers and scrolling text.
- 🎛️ **Dual Trigger Modes:** Choose between hands-free wake word activation ("Hey Jarvis") or push-to-talk using the hardware BOOT button.
- 🔊 **Digital Volume Control:** Dynamic PCM amplitude scaling with clipping protection built right into the backend.
- 🔌 **Modular C Firmware:** Developed using ESP-IDF v5.5.4 and FreeRTOS for smooth multitasking and memory optimization.

## ⚡ Quick Start Guide

### 1️⃣ Prepare the AI Brain (Backend)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishu2212/jarvis-ai-assistant.git
   cd jarvis-ai-assistant/backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/macOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start **LM Studio**, download `qwen2.5-7b-instruct`, and start the local server on port `1234`.
5. Run the FastAPI backend:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### 2️⃣ Flash the Hardware Satellite (ESP32-S3 Firmware)

1. Open your ESP-IDF command prompt (v5.5.4 recommended).
2. Navigate to the custom firmware directory:
   ```bash
   cd firmware/jarvis-esp32
   ```
3. Set target and compile:
   ```bash
   idf.py set-target esp32s3
   idf.py build
   ```
4. Flash the board and open serial monitor (replace `COMX` with your COM port):
   ```bash
   idf.py -p COMX flash monitor
   ```

## 🎮 How to Interact with JARVIS

1. **Power Up:** Connect the ESP32-S3 via USB-C. You will see `Starting JARVIS...` followed by `Connecting WiFi...` on the OLED screen.
2. **Ready Prompt:** Once connected, JARVIS plays a welcome chime and says *"Hello, I am Jarvis."* The screen displays `Ready. Say: 'Hey Jarvis' or press BOOT`.
3. **Ask a Question:**
   - **Hands-Free:** Say *"Hey Jarvis"* to trigger listening mode.
   - **Manual:** Press and hold the physical **BOOT button (GPIO 0)** while speaking, then release when finished.
4. **Watch JARVIS Think & Speak:** JARVIS will show `Thinking...` while analyzing your query, then scroll the answer on screen while speaking out loud through the speaker!
